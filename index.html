<!--
v1.0: initial releast
v1.0.1: fixed a small HTML formatting error, added delete in addition to backspace as keys to clear board.
v1.0.2 and 1.0.3: switched to 1000x1000, and then back to 800x800 when I realized 1000x1000 is too big.
v1.1.0: added the ability to randomize the board.
c1.1.1: clarified the instructions
