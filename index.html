<!--
v1.0: initial releast
v1.0.1: fixed a small HTML formatting error, added delete in addition to backspace as keys to clear board.
v1.0.2 and 1.0.3: switched to 1000x1000, and then back to 800x800 when I realized 1000x1000 is too big.
v1.1.0: added the ability to randomize the board.
v1.1.1: clarified the instructions
v1.2.0: allow scaling of window, among other things
v1.3.0: revert to 1.1.1
v1.4.0: decided that my reversion was a bad idea. Window can be scaled. Also changed the keybind on the delete function.
v1.4.1: fixed minor bug, changed instructions
v1.4.2: 1.4.1, but for real this time. Forgot to actually copy-paste the code!
