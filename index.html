		    When paused, you can toggle cells on and off by clicking them.
		    Spacebar: pause/unpase<br>
		    Up and down arrows: Change grid size (up=increase size, down=decrease). Only works when paused<br>
		    Left and right arrows: Change framerate (right=higher, left=lower)<br>
		    Backslash [\]: Clear the grid. Only works when paused <br>
		    Tilde [~] (but without the shift, so actually a backquote `): Randomize the state of the grid. Only works when paused.<br>
		    Enter: Move forward one generation (one frame). Only works when paused <br>
		     <br>
		    1-9 and 0 keys (not on the numpad) create different patterns. 1-5 create objects known as oscillators, which cycle between a few shapes. 4-9 create spaceships, which slowly move accross the screen. 0 creates a type of spaceship gun, which steadily creates small spaceships. If the object doesn't show up when you press the key, it means you need to increase the size of the grid.

		    There are more patterns listed on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns">wikipedia page</a> for the game of life, as well as on the online game of life's <a href="https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon">lexicon page</a>

<!--
v1.0: initial release
v1.0.1: fixed a small HTML formatting error, added delete in addition to backspace as keys to clear board.
v1.0.2 and 1.0.3: switched to 1000x1000, and then back to 800x800 when I realized 1000x1000 is too big.
v1.1.0: added the ability to randomize the board.
v1.1.1: clarified the instructions
v1.2.0: allow scaling of window, among other things
v1.3.0: revert to 1.1.1
v1.4.0: decided that my reversion was a bad idea. Window can be scaled. Also changed the keybind on the delete function.
v1.4.1: fixed minor bug, changed instructions
v1.4.1, part II: 1.4.1, but for real this time. Forgot to actually copy-paste the code!
v1.4.2: hopefully fixed a bug with integer division
		Heck, I broke it
v1.4.3: unbroke it??? maybe??? The size changer still isn't working, but at least the program will run?
v1.5.0: fully fixed, controls work, added another creatable object.
